      description: "This project implements a custom Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) using NumPy to approximate nonlinear functions. It supports various activation functions and is trained using backpropagation and mean squared error. The model was tested on the following functions: exp(x), sin(x) / x, and sin(x) + cos(y). These experiments demonstrate the MLP's ability to learn and generalize complex patterns from data",
